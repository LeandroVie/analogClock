# analogClock


This is a responsive analog clock. It displays the current hour, minute, and second. The hour hand is black, the minute hand is gray, and the second hand is red.

I created the entire clock in style.css. There, I defined the colors, sizes, and positions. I also defined the clock's responsiveness.

In analogClock.js, I defined that the clock displays the current time. I also made the hands move according to the time.
